# Wayside Waifs Humane Education Application

Duration: 3 week sprint

## Description

The Wayside Waifs Humane Education Application is a data tracking system that allows clients to send requests for an event to Wayside Waifs. Once a client has submitted an event request, an educator for Wayside Waifs will be able to view all requests and assign them to the proper educator. Registration as a volunteer will allow the user to view the classes they have been assigned to. Registration as an educator will allow the user access to create accounts, edit and assign events, and view a dynamic set of reports based upon the information from a group of events.
